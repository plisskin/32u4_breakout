# Atmega32U4 Breakout Board

This is a simple breakout board for the Atmega32U4 microcontroller.  It brings out all of the pins to headers and also provides places for a crystal resonator and an ICSP programming header.  

All of the power pins route to the top of the board where power can be connected in a single spot and all of the ground pins route to the bottom of the board where ground can be connected in a single spot.  The intention is to use jumpers to connect the power/ground pins to the power/ground 'header'.

Created using KiCad 8 and routed using freerouter.
